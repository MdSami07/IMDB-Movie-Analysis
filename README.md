# IMDB-Movie-Analysis
*IMDb (Internet Movie Database)* is an online database that provides information about movies, TV shows, actors, directors, and other industry professionals. It is a popular platform where users can access a vast collection of movie-related data, including ratings, reviews, cast and crew information, release dates, and more.

In this project, I have performed analysis on the IMDb movies dataset
and displayed meaningful information from the dataset through MS Excel. The Internet Movie
Database (IMDb) is a website that serves as an online database of world cinema containing a
large number of public data on films such as the title of the film, the year of release of the
film, the genre of the film, the audience, budget, revenue, the rating of critics, the duration of
the film, the summary of the film, actors, directors and much more.

Initially, after studying the columns of the dataset I got to know in the IMDb dataset there are
some non-useful columns that are not useful in the analysis work and some rows have null
values therefore our analysis work started with cleaning the data.  

We are required to provide a detailed report for the below data record mentioning the
answers to the questions that follow:  

1. **Cleaning the data:** Clean the data
2. **Movies with the highest profit:** Find the movies with the highest profit.
3. **Top 250:** Find IMDB Top 250
4. **Best Directors:** Find the best directors

6. **Charts:** Find the critic-favorite and audience-favorite actors
